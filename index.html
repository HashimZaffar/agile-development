                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>Agile development is a set of methodologies and practices for managing and executing software development projects. It emphasizes iterative progress, collaboration, and flexibility. Agile methodologies focus on delivering small, working increments of software frequently, which allows teams to adapt to changing requirements and customer feedback more effectively.</p>
            </section>

            <section id="principles">
                <h2>Agile Principles</h2>
                <p>The Agile Manifesto outlines twelve key principles:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Customer satisfaction through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.</li>
                    <li>Welcome changing requirements, even late in development.</li>
                    <li>Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months.</li>
                    <li>Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project.</li>
                    <li>Build projects around motivated individuals who are trusted to get the job done.</li>
                    <li>Convey information face-to-face as much as possible.</li>
                    <li>Working software is the primary measure of progress.</li>
                    <li>Sustainable development, able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.</li>
                    <li>Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.</li>
                    <li>Simplicity—the art of maximizing the amount of work not done—is essential.</li>
                    <li>The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.</li>
                    <li>At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective and adjusts accordingly.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section id="methods">

                    <li><strong>Lean Software Development:</strong> Focuses on improving efficiency by eliminating waste and improving processes. Principles include delivering faster, respecting people, and optimizing the whole system.</li>
                    <li><strong>Feature-Driven Development (FDD):</strong> A model-driven, short-iteration process that focuses on defining and building features iteratively.</li>
                </ul>
